# islands-nanostores demo

Observe Vue, Svelte, and Solid-js component islands, communicating 
via a persistent nanostore.

Either Vue or Svelte versions of a non-rendering api pull component 
can be chosen to give dynamic updating, also via the nanostore. 

To operate: pnpm dev; use link to open in browser

- use buttons to update from each component, observing others
- observe the updating every two seconds from free open api
